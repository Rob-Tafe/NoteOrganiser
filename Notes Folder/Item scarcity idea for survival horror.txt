Item scarcity idea for survival horror focused medieval fantasy

Weapons to have durability, and will break when durability runs out, but the player keeps
the broken weapon, and can have it reforged with the right materials - this ensures that
the player can keep access to their preferred weapon, but still has to deal with the enforced
resource scarcity common in the survival horror genre.

Perhaps something like 'Bluesteel shards' to repair a longsword, or 'Redsteel shards' to
repair a bastard sword?

As far as the tarot spell system is concerned, each suit can be a 'spellbook' type item.
It could provide the player with access to all the spells in that specific suit, and all
the resource cards too, but once all the resource cards are spent, the suit need to be recharged.
The resource cards would loose their images/text if used to cast a spell, rendering them
inert, and the player would have to reinscribe them with 'Magical Ink' in order to use them
again.
