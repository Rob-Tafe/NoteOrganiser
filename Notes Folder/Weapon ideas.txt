Weapon ideas


Weapon: Longsword
Name: Valiant
Description: Sword with a two-handed grip and a long, slender blade made for thrusting and
slashing. Made primarily for two-handed usage, it can also be used one handed.
Inspiration: Oakshott Type XVIIIb, Valiant Armory's 'VA-144 Craftsman'.


Weapon: Bastard sword
Name: Stalwart
Description: Sword with a hand-and-a-half grip, and a solid blade that is wide at the base,
but tapers off to a wicked point. Made mostly for slashing, but is effective with thrusts
also. Made to be as versatile as possible, it is ideal for one handed usage and performs
acceptably when used two handed.
Inspiration: Oakshott Type XVa, 'Bastard sword' by Maciej Kopciuch, 'The Mercenary' by Albion
Swords.
