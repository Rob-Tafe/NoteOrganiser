Survival horror/Souls-like/Dark fantasy setting idea

The setting is a mysterious castle, shrouded in fog, with dark clouds and heavy rain in seemingly
endless supply. The castle is set into the side of a great mountain, which is part of a large
mountain range that travels onwards to the southwest. The mountain range opens up into a valley
to the north east, where the terrain becomes open fields and forests, littered with towns
and farmland, with the occasional keep and even a fortress or two. Beyond this seemingly idyllic
landscape lies a great ocean, wracked by powerful winds.
