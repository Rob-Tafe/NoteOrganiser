Death/checkpoint/Progression idea

Safe rooms should be the equivelant to the 'sites of grace' from Elden Ring, or the 'bonfires'
from Dark Souls. A safe room should be a small room with a bed of some sort, and a few other
common elements such as a trunk (to store excess gear) a desk for the main character to attune
to different magic/skills/other character build-related options. It should also have a candle
or a lantern, that, when lit, 'activates' the safe house, similar to setting the last grace
visited in Elden Ring.

If the main character should perish, they will wake up in the last safe house that was activated
without any of their 'Memories'. There will not be any "You Died" text at the time of death,
but when the main character respawns, they will be text along the lines of "Another Bad Dream"
or "Another Nightmare to shake off" or "Wake up, Quickly!" (The idea is to be a slightly more  motivational 'death phrase', to avoid focusing on the player on the negative, and to get the
player to keep pushing onwards).

Memories - The equivelant to souls & runes. if the main character dies, they will drop them
on the ground where they died.
